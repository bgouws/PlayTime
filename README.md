# PlayTime

## Summary
Play Time is a productivity app which will replace conventional timers with exciting custom timers, it will allow users to set up tasks and allocate a duration for each of these tasks, it will then use the Apple Music API to generate a playlist based on user taste which will last for the duration of the task they set.

## Eventual Goals

Possibly use machine learning to determine what type of songs should be played for the user, for example if the user selectedf the genre "Rock" it contains multiple sub genres like Alternative, math, etc...

So if the user were to create a task such as "Running or gym" the application should rather select a sub genre that suits the activity such as "punk rock"

Whereas if the user selects a task called "Break" or "Rest" it should select a sub genre like "Soul"
